14:05 Stopped logging in order to add additional SHP1
14:14 Started logging of both SHP1 instruments
14:26 Both instruments are aligned and cleaned. Made minor adjustments to the first SHP1 too (but very minor).

08:58: Started measuring both SHP1 instruments. Both were clean and aligned prior to logging.



I noticed that the calibration coefficient for my SHP1-185163 pyrheliometer is incorrectly listed in the 2021 IPC report. I wrote about it in the email below, but I guessed it was missed.

TODO
- Write Joob about documents
- Add instruments/pyrgeometer on IPC page

CHP1 serial number: 090137
Original calibration: 8.08 2009
