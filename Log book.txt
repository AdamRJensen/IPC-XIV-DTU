Aligned before
9.14: Cleaned with wipes
9:16: Restarted logging to make sure file output was good
9:42: Change calibration coefficient from 8.61577 to 8.52
14:05 Stopped logging in order to add additional SHP1
14:14 Started logging of both SHP1 instruments
14:26 Both instruments are aligned and cleaned. Made minor adjustments to the first SHP1 too (but very minor). 
15:51: Cleaned both glasses (looked clean already, only tiny speckles)
16.27. Stopped logging the two SHP1s
16:3X: Started logging DR30
16:35: Cleaned DR30

08:58: Started measuring both SHP1 instruments. Both were clean and aligned prior to logging.

09:0X - Started logging measurements after the second or third official measurement. Instruments were cleaned at the start and aligned, so there should not be any need for data filtering.
10:30 ish - for unknown reasons, the behavior of the Angstrom instrument changed. Previously the current for the right and left chamber deviated by approximately 13%. After 13:00 the current applied to the two chambers was almost the same (as should be expected).
10:53 - Cleaned lower pyrheliometer (feather outside the window, shouldn't have influenced measurements.) Cleaning down outside of cadence, so no need to filter out data.
11:30 Started logging CHP1. Cleaned the first two minutes, which should be filtered out.

09:22-09:23 Re-cleaned both instruments. SHP1-18... seemed to have residual stuff on the window.
09:26 Cleaned window of CHP1, didn't seem bad though.
10:35 Sensors weren't logging, so I disconnected the modbus converter and restarted the datalogger program. No significant data was lost as it was partly cloudy during this period.
16:13 cleaned DR30


CHP1 serial number: 090137
Original calibration: 8.08 2009
